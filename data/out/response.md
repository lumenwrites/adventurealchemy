# How to Train Your Dragon

## Core Ideas
**Setting:** A world inhabited by humans and dragons, with the unique aspect of dragons raiding human villages for food. The major problem is the constant threat posed by these dragons on the villagers.

**Objective:** The heroes strive to create peace and understanding between humans and dragons, overcoming generations of animosity. The goal is important as the ongoing conflict puts both humans and dragons in danger. The challenge lies in persuading villagers and dragons alike to change their deep-rooted beliefs and instincts.

**Antagonist:** The main antagonist is a colossal dragon called the Red Death, who dominates other dragons and pushes them to raid the humans' village for food. The Red Death's motivation is its hunger and control over other dragons.

**Plot Twist:** The heroes discover the Red Death at the center of the conflict, as it forces other dragons into attacking the village. This heightens the stakes and sets up a dire confrontation with the Red Death.

## Key Scenes
**Inciting Incident:** The heroes discover a wounded dragon and, instead of killing it, choose to heal and bond with it. This encounter leads them to realize the misunderstanding and deep connection that exists between humans and dragons. Failing to bridge this gap would result in continued conflict and loss of life on both sides.

**Escalating Challenges:**

1. The scene takes place in a hidden clearing. The heroes want to train and befriend the previously wounded dragon, and to do that, they must overcome the fear of being attacked by the dragon. In order to achieve this, the heroes will learn to communicate with and understand the dragon. This action leads the heroes to learn more about dragons and their complex nature.

2. The scene takes place in the dragon's training ring. The heroes want to demonstrate the possibility of human-dragon relationships to the villagers, and they must overcome the villagers' skepticism and possible backlash. In order to do this, the heroes will secretly train the dragon and eventually showcase their bond, surprising the village. This leads into the heroes venturing further into dragon territory.

3. The scene takes place in the dragon's lair. The heroes want to discover the real reason why the dragons raid the village, and to do that they must infiltrate the dragons' lair while evading danger. To overcome this challenge, the heroes and their dragon ally will covertly navigate the lair, eventually discovering the mighty Red Death. The scene reveals the true antagonist for both humans and dragons.

4. The scene takes place at the village. The heroes want to convince the village to help fight against the Red Death, and they must overcome the villagers' long-held hatred for dragons. They will reveal the common enemy and share their insights to gain the villagers' trust. This leads the heroes and the village to prepare for the climactic battle.

5. The scene takes place in the sky outside the dragon's lair. The heroes want to lead a coalition of dragons and humans against the Red Death, and to do that they must overcome initial distrust and chaos among the two groups. In order to create unity and coordination, the heroes will forge temporary alliances and lead by example, demonstrating teamwork in the face of adversity. This foreshadows the potential of a unified world between humans and dragons.

**Climax:** The scene takes place at the Red Death's lair. The heroes must confront and defeat the Red Death, the most fearsome and dangerous dragon, to protect the village and end the ongoing conflict. To overcome its massive size and power, the heroes will use their newfound knowledge of dragons to coordinate a large scale aerial battle with the dragons and villagers working together. Victory in this battle marks the beginning of a new era of peace between humans and dragons.
