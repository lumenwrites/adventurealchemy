**Prompts:**
"The Shining" meets "The Addams Family"
Combine the most interesting ideas from these two movies to create a new and exciting story that makes sense.
**Pitch:** The story takes place in a haunted hotel owned by a quirky, peculiar family. The heroes must locate and safely relocate the ghosts inhabiting the hotel to prevent it from being demolished by a greedy developer. The main challenge is convincing each unique ghost to leave while dealing with the family's bizarre and supernatural antics.
**Setting:** The adventure takes place in Ghastly Manor, a once-opulent Victorian-era hotel located on a cliff overlooking a picturesque coastal town. The town is a tourist destination famed for its beautiful beaches and bizarre supernatural occurrences. The town’s primary problem is the rapid encroachment of modern development, which conflicts with the town’s historic charm and supernatural phenomena.
**Objective:** The heroes must locate, communicate with, and safely relocate each of the numerous ghosts haunting Ghastly Manor in order to save the hotel from being destroyed by ambitious developer Maximillian Malone. This task is challenging because the ghosts have different motivations for remaining in the hotel, and the eccentric living family who owns the hotel constantly meddle in the heroes' efforts.
**Antagonist:** Maximillian Malone is a smooth-talking, well-dressed businessman with a shark-like grin. He owns a construction company and desires to demolish Ghastly Manor and build a new luxury resort. His motivation is purely profit-driven; he believes that he can turn the entire town into a more upscale destination by replacing its “outdated” buildings with his own brand-new constructions.

If the heroes fail in their mission, the historic hotel will be destroyed, permanently displacing the ghosts and disrupting the supernatural balance in the coastal town.

In order to succeed, the heroes must use dance and performance to show that there is an even more exciting location for the ghostly inhabitants to go.
4. The scene takes place in the catacombs beneath the hotel. The heroes must face off against a vengeful ghost who is guarding the source of the hotel's supernatural energy. To counter this, the heroes must empathize with the ghost's personal history and redirect the ghost's energy to a more constructive location.
5. The scene takes place during a town-wide festival celebrating the town's supernatural history.
