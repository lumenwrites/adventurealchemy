**Prompts:**
"Pocahontas" meets "Blade"
**Pitch:** The story takes place in colonial Virginia, where the heroes must unite the Powhatan tribe and the African slaves to fend off a vampire invasion. The heroes' biggest challenge will be breaking down the cultural barriers between the two groups and convincing them to work together in the face of the common enemy.
**Setting:** Colonial Virginia, with both African slaves and the Powhatan tribe living there, and a small vampire population.
**Objective:** The heroes must unite the Powhatan tribe and the African slaves to fend off a vampire invasion. They must convince both groups to work together, despite their culture and language differences, in the face of the common enemy. Failure to do so will result in the destruction of both groups and the expansion of the vampire population.
**Antagonist:** A vampire named Baron Von Blood, tall and pale with black hair and piercing blue eyes, who seeks to eradicate the indigenous and slave populations to make way for a new vampire utopia.
**Exciting Adventure Hook:** The heroes arrive at an abandoned village only to find both Powhatan and African slaves living there, trying to avoid the vampire onslaught. They soon realize that the only way to defeat the vampires is to unite the two groups, but they are distrustful of each other and believe that either group is better off without the other.
**Plot Twist:** One of the slaves is bitten by a vampire and begins to turn. The heroes must decide whether to kill the slave or find a cure, delaying their progress in uniting the two groups.
**Climax:**
- Location: The climax takes place in a large clearing where the vampires are preparing to attack the united force of Powhatan and slaves.
- Challenge: The heroes must fight Baron Von Blood, who has grown stronger by feeding on the slaves and Powhatan tribe members he has already defeated. He can only be defeated by destroying his source of power - a small bottle of blood hanging around his neck that contains the essence of the first vampire.
- Action: The heroes must fight their way through the vampire horde and reach Baron Von Blood, where they face off in a fierce battle. One of the heroes must grab the bottle and smash it, causing Baron Von Blood to explode in a shower of blood and gore, destroying all the other vampires in the area.
