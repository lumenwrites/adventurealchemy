Pitch: The story takes place in an abandoned settlement that has been taken over by competing bird nests, who are at each other's throats over the best real estate. The heroes are hired by a bird-nest builder who needs their help to pit the nests against each other in order to get them to leave their prime building location. The biggest challenge will be convincing the feuding bird-nests to trust the heroes long enough to help them pull off their plan.
Setting: The world is inhabited by sentient, competitive bird-nests that build elaborate structures out of natural materials, vying for the best locations to construct their homes.
Objective: The heroes must help a bird-nest builder, Talon, drive out the competing bird-nests from the prime building location where he needs to construct a nest for a rare and endangered bird species. If they fail, the species will lose its chance for survival. The biggest challenge will be earning the trust of the feuding bird-nests in order to turn them against each other.
Antagonist: The main antagonist is the leader of the largest competing bird-nest, a ruthless and cunning raven named Corvus who will stop at nothing to claim the prime building location for his nest's needs.
Exciting Adventure Hook: The heroes are hired by Talon, the bird-nest builder who needs their help to convince the rivaling bird-nests to fight amongst themselves to get them to abandon the prime building location. If Talon fails, his rare bird species will become extinct, and the ecosystem will suffer.
Plot Twist: A wise old owl reveals to the heroes that the rare bird species is actually a carrier of a potent healing plant that the competing bird-nests have also discovered. The situation has escalated into a potential disaster for the ecosystem since the healing plant is in danger of overuse and extinction.
Climax (Lead a group or run an organization): The final challenge takes place on an abandoned biplane perched atop the tallest tree in the prime location.
- Location: The biplane is located at the highest point in the prime building location and provides an excellent view of the surrounding area.
- Challenge: The heroes must lead a discussion between all the competing bird nests while fending off an attack from Corvus and his minions who are trying to take control of the biplane.
- Action: The heroes decide to have all the bird-nests compete in an elaborate obstacle course, with the fastest nest winning the prime location. The heroes will need to design and oversee the obstacle course to ensure that each bird-nest has an equal chance of winning.
