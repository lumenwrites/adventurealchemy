Setting: A city-sized skeleton of a gigantic sea turtle sails the oceans, powered by necromancy. The pirate city is built inside its shell. The turtle is controlled by a necromancer who has turned all the pirates undead, and uses them to attack ships, capture more victims, and grow his army.
Objective: The playersâ€™ are tasked to sail along with a rich merchant and protect his cargo. In the midst of a storm, the players and their ship crew have been attacked by the undead turtle and its pirates, captured, and taken to cages. Now they must escape the cages, infiltrate the pirates, and journey through the turtle to the turtle's skull, where the necromancer's headquarters is. There they must find a way to gain control over the turtle so they could sail it back home and liberate their crew and the undead pirates.
