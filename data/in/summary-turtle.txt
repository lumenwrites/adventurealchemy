Setting: A city-sized skeleton of a gigantic sea turtle sails the oceans, powered by necromancy. The pirate city is built inside its shell. The turtle is controlled by a necromancer who has turned all the pirates undead, and uses them to attack ships, capture more victims, and grow his army.
Objective: The players and their ship crew have been captured by pirates and taken to cages. Their objective is to escape the cages, infiltrate the pirates, and journey through the turtle to the turtle's skull, where the necromancer's headquarters is. There they can obtain the necromancer's spellbook and use it to control the turtle so they could sail it back home and liberate the undead pirates.
Adventure hook: The heroes sail the ship during the storm, tasked to protect the ship and its passengers (a rich merchant and his daughter). An enormous turtle arises from the ocean. Slams against the hull, the ship begins to sink, the undead pirates board the ship, capture the passengers, and take them to the cages.
