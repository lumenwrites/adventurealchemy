## Swallowed by a giant alien whale, the heroes must impress the parasites who live inside in order to escape
**Pitch:** The story takes place on an alien planet, inside the belly of a giant whale, where the heroes meet a stranded alien prince who was also swallowed by the creature. To escape, the prince needs to impress a group of sentient parasites living in the whale's gut. The biggest challenge the heroes will face is navigating through the labyrinthine intestinal system of the whale, dodging the angry parasites and avoiding being digested.
**Setting:** The adventure takes place inside the belly of a giant alien whale, a unique creature that inhabits the depths of the ocean on an alien planet. The biggest problem in this world is the scarcity of the whale's favorite food, forcing it to resort to swallowing anything that comes across its path, which is why it has swallowed the heroes' spaceship.
**Objective:** The heroes must help the stranded alien prince escape from the belly of the space whale by impressing the group of sentient parasites living in the whale's gut with a musical ritual. If they fail, they will be digested by the whale, and the prince will remain trapped forever. The challenge is that the parasites are a tough audience, and the heroes must figure out the right notes and melodies to play to impress them.
**Antagonist:** The main antagonist is the queen of the parasites who is obsessed with maintaining the ancient parasite's rules and customs.
**Exciting Adventure Hook:** The heroes arrive on the ocean-covered planet as a part of a rescue mission looking for a missing alien prince. Their ship is swallowed by the whale, where they stumble upon the stranded alien prince who has been waiting for a way out. He tells them about the musical ritual he needs to perform to impress the parasites, and the heroes agree to help him escape. However, they must hurry as the whale's digestive system is beginning to fill with the digestive juices, and they must reach the exit before it's too late.
**Plot Twist:** As the heroes make their way through the whale's labyrinthine intestine, they discover that the parasites are not easily impressed by music. They have an insatiable craving for a rare mineral found in the belly of the whale, and without it, the prince's music will be useless. The heroes must now face the dilemma of finding the mineral or trying to convince the parasites to accept an alternative form of payment.
**Climax:**
- Location: The climax takes place in a massive chamber deep within the whale's belly, where the parasite's queen resides.
- Challenge: The heroes must fight their way through hordes of angry parasites and reach the queen, all while avoiding being digested by the whale's stomach acid.
- Action: The heroes are helped by the prince, who uses his musical skills to control the parasites and distract them. They reach the queen, but instead of fighting her, they negotiate a deal in which they will provide the minerals the parasites crave in exchange for safe passage out of the whale. Through a combination of musical skill and clever diplomacy, the heroes succeed in their quest and escape the space whale's belly.
