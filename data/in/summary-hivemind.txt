Pitch: The story takes place in a twisted village where the citizens are all part of a hivemind controlled by a powerful creature who will stop at nothing to protect its hold on the villagers. The heroes must explore the village and scout out a way to break the creature's control over the citizens or risk having more and more people become part of the hivemind themselves. The biggest challenge the heroes face will be avoiding the citizens and the creature's minions while they explore the dangerous streets of the village.
Setting: The village of Thornville appears normal at first glance, but the citizens are all part of a hivemind controlled by a powerful creature known as the Weaver who has been slowly taking over the town for years.
Objective: The heroes must explore the town and find a way to break the Weaver's control over the citizens before it's too late and everyone is assimilated into the hivemind. The Weaver's minions and the citizens themselves will stand in the way of the heroes.
Antagonist: The Weaver is a monstrous spider-like creature that creates a web of psychic energy controlling the citizens. It seeks to assimilate as many people as possible and expand its control over the entire region.
Exciting Adventure Hook: The heroes arrive in Thornville to investigate reports of strange behavior and disappearances. They soon discover that the entire town is under the control of the Weaver and must act fast to prevent more people from being assimilated before it's too late.
Plot Twist: The heroes discover that the only way to break the Weaver's control is to destroy the central node of its psychic web, which is located inside a heavily guarded church in the center of town. However, doing so will release the psychic energy back into the citizens and cause them to go insane.
Climax (Track or find someone):
- Location: The central church in Thornville, a gothic building with stained glass windows and ominous gargoyles.
- Challenge: The heroes must find a way to track down the location of the central node while avoiding detection by the Weaver's minions and the assimilated citizens.
- Action: The heroes must navigate through the church while fending off attacks from the Weaver's minions and avoiding traps. When they finally locate the central node, they engage in a psychic battle with the Weaver to destroy the node and break the creature's hold over the town. As the psychic energy is released into the townsfolk, the heroes must use all their wits and skills to avoid being killed by the now-insane citizens.
