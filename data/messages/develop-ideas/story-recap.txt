I need help writing a lighthearted one-shot adventure for a table-top roleplaying game. It is a short, self-contained story that can be played through in 1-2 hours. The players (the main characters, I will call them “heroes”) will play as characters in an interesting lighthearted fictional setting (the world where the story takes place), they will strive to overcome fun and challenging obstacles on the path to their objective (achieving some exciting goal or solving some important problem).

I have already brainstormed some ideas, and now I want you to help me develop the plot of the story. I will give you the ideas I have brainstormed so far, and you will write a brief description of the plot of the story, describing all the key details of the story, and what players will do during the adventure.

The adventure must be focused on roleplaying and collaboratively telling an interesting and exciting story, not on solving puzzles or fighting in combat encounters. The adventure should have some epic and exciting action scenes, and some dramatic and fun roleplaying encounters.

Be as specific and concrete as you can, provide details and concrete examples, do not be abstract, mysterious, or vague. For example, when describing the antagonist, saying "a ruthless vampire" is better than saying "a villain", and when describing an event, saying "a king's wedding" is better than saying "a social event". The more specific you are - the better.

Be clear about all the most important events, the locations where they take place, and the challenges the heroes must overcome. The summary should be no longer than 5 sentences.

Convey as much information and as many ideas as you can, while staying concise.

Here's a good example of a developed adventure plot:

The heroes are traveling through a magic forest when they come across a sad baby dragon who tells them that his mother has been kidnapped by a group of warriors. The heroes agree to help and begin tracking the mama dragon through the dangerous forest until they find the city where she was taken. In order to infiltrate the city, the heroes must convince, bribe, or intimidate the guards at the gates. Once inside the city, the heroes talk to the locals and discover that the dragon mom is being held captive in the Coliseum, where she is forced to fight for the public's entertainment. The only way for the heroes to get close enough to the dragon to free her is to enter the Coliseum as gladiators, so they talk or sneak their way into the gladiator pits. Once they enter the arena, they struggle to negotiate with the enraged dragon and convince her that they’re trying to help. They see the evil princess, her guards, and her court mage watching the show from the stands. In order to liberate the dragon, they reach the stands and get their hands on the mage’s spell book for long enough to learn the spell that can unlock the magic collar around the dragon’s neck. During the climax of the story, the heroes cast a spell to liberate the dragon while protecting themselves and the innocent bystanders from the mage and the guards.

Here are the ideas for my adventure I have brainstormed so far:
