I need help writing a lighthearted one-shot adventure for a table-top roleplaying game. It is a short, self-contained story that can be played through in 1-2 hours. The players (the main characters, I will call them “heroes”) will play as characters in an interesting lighthearted fictional setting (the world where the story takes place), they will strive to overcome fun and challenging obstacles on the path to their objective (achieving some exciting goal or solving some important problem). 

I need a list of ideas for interesting and exciting problems the heroes will need to solve throughout the story.

Here are some examples of the type of ideas I'm looking for:

A priceless object has disappeared
A person has disappeared
Someone has been kidnapped
A villain has taken hostages
Someone discovers a dangerous secret
Someone is trapped in a dangerous location
Someone is conducting a dangerous experiment
An innocnet person is charged with a crime
A location is under attack from dangerous creature
A natural disaster has occurred
An ancient curse has been activated
An extremely dangerous discovery has been made
The heroes are stranded in the wilderness
An innocent creature is hunted by a deadly hunter
A dangerous prisoner has escaped

Please make a list of 50 interesting, challenging, exciting problems for the heroes to solve.
