My goal is to analyze movies, and make a collection of the common types of objectives the protagonists pursue throughout the story.

An objective is a goal the protagonist strives to achieve throughout the story, a problem they're striving to solve, a challenge they need to overcome. It is the main thing they want to accomplish. Throughout the story they obstacles on their path to this objective, and finally accomplish it at the climax.

Here are the goal types I have collected so far:
Defeat a person or a creature
Obtain an object or information
Rescue or protect someone
Chase or capture someone
Escape from the pursuit
Kidnap someone
Sabotage a project
Complete a project
Destroy a target
