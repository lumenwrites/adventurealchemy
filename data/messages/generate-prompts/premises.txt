I want you to help me to make a list of creative writing prompts.

I need a list of ideas for interesting high-concept premises for action/adventure movies. These can be interesting supernatural elements, magics, technologies, items, creatures, etc.

Here are some good examples:

Antropomorphic animals
Monster's egg
Truth serum
Illusion magic
Voodoo
Holograms
Pet monsters
Objects turned sentient
People shrunk to a tiny size
Hivemind
Brain slugs
Superpowers
Genetic engineering
Cursed treasure
Truth Serum
Evil clones/dopplegangers
Sapient Plants
Portals/Stargates
Sentient items
Grim Reaper
Mutations
A person turned into an animal
Portal to another world
Mind control
Possession

Please make a list of 50 more awesome high-concept premises. Make ideas as different from each other as possible.
