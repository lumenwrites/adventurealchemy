I want you to help me make a list of types of exciting challenges characters encounter in stories, action/adventure movies, and roleplaying games. Challenges are the obstacles the protagonists must overcome as they pursue their goal, interesting problems they need to solve.

Here's the list I have so far:
- Exciting action scenes (for example: chase scenes, racing, combat, train heists, piloting vehicles, riding animals, destroying buildings, etc.)
- Dramatic social encounters, roleplay-focused challenges (for example: negotiations, deception, persuasion, intrigue, diplomacy, politics, navigating strange cultures, etc.)
- Exploration of fun, interesting, or dangerous environments (for example: climbing dangerous cliffs, crossing chasms, escaping from collapsing buildings, breaking into protected buildings, etc.)
- Survival (for example: overcoming environmental obstacles, taming animals, finding food and water, building shelter, fending off predators, etc.)
- Stealth (for example: sneaking, hiding from patrols, infiltration, impersonation, espionage, subtrefuge, smuggling, cleaning up evidence, covering your tracks, heists, etc.)
- Mystery (for example: looking for clues, tracking footprints, etc.)
- High concept challenges, dealing with interesting technologies or magics (for example: stopping a dangerous ritual, facing ghosts, hacking robots, repairing devices, building and crafting things, etc.)
- Dealing with setbacks and complications (for example: some important item is broken or stolen, betrayal a close ally, getting ambushed, transportation breaks, time pressure, competing with rivals, some important information turns out to be false, getting framed for a crime, etc.)
- Responding to the moves villain makes (for example: rescuing villain's hostages, diffusing a bomb they've set, chasing them when they escape, etc.)
