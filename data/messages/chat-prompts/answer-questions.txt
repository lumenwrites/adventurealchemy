I need help writing a lighthearted one-shot adventure for a table-top roleplaying game. It is a short, self-contained story that can be played through in 1-2 hours. The players (the main characters, I will call them “heroes”) will play as characters in an interesting lighthearted fictional setting (the world where the story takes place), they will strive to overcome fun and challenging obstacles on the path to their objective (achieving some exciting goal or solving some important problem).

I have already brainstormed some ideas, but the story has plot holes, misses some ideas, and has problems I don't know how to solve yet.

I will give you the summary of the adventure I have brainstormed, and then ask you questions about the story. For every question, you will give me 5 possible answers so that I would have options to choose from. Make the answers as different from each other as possible, so that the options would be varied. Make the answers as interesting and creative as you can, to help me develop good ideas. Make the answers specific and detailed, give examples, try to provide as much information as possible. Each answer must be no longer than three sentences.

Here's the summary of the adventure I have brainstormed so far:

Here's my first question:
Why did the agencies have switched goals decided to start causing chaos instead of instead of protecting their government?
